    KeyProbe is a FastMCP server that detects, parses, and summarizes certificate/keystore
    formats. It extracts subjects/issuers, validity dates, key/signature algorithms, SANs,
    usages, entry counts, size, and SHA-256 digests. Read-only and idempotent; no private
    key material is returned.
